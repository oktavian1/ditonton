The goal is to provide the definitive viewing experience of Naruto -- for both old and new viewers. Each arc is presented as a film/series of films. Meaning, episodes are seamlessly stitched together to create a naturally flowing story arc. In addition to that, all unnecessary filler, fluff, and padding are cut.",
